# cardGames

This is a work in progress.

Currently, the application will create a 52 card deck as an array and deal seven cards from it for two players.
Each card in the deck array is an object representing each {suit, face}.
Every card dealt is removed from the deck array and pushed to a hand array.
For each suit there are icons associated with them Spades use the spade HTML entity &#9824; and so on.
